This jupyter notebook is based on a case study of a coffee shop where the goal is to predict the number of reviews according to the features in the dataset.
This is a good example of how to manage missing values, categorical values and different regression models. 
However, it is important to remark that these models may perform even better after tuning some hyperparameters.

Hope you enjoy it!
